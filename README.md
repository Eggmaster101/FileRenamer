# Batch File Renamer

Created this for personal use in order to make mass repetitive filename changes easier to do. Currently there are options to either swap a string present in the original filename for another string (or remove it entirely), or to add a given string to the beginning of all filenames at either the beginning or the end. Very rudimentary, and applies to all files within a selected folder so use carefully.
